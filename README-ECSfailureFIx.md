Since your ECS infrastructure was created with Terraform, you should **fix the issues in your Terraform code** rather than directly in the AWS console. This ensures:
1. Future spins-up won't have the same issues
2. Your infrastructure remains consistent with your code (avoiding configuration drift)
3. Changes can be properly version-controlled

## How to Fix in Terraform

### 1. Security Group Issue
**Problem**: The security group `sg-0cd7b2ac95796628c` doesn't exist but is referenced.

**Solutions**:
```hcl
# Option A: Reference an existing security group by lookup (recommended)
data "aws_security_group" "existing_sg" {
  name = "your-existing-sg-name" # or use tags/filter
}

# Option B: Create a new security group (if you need custom rules)
resource "aws_security_group" "ecs_sg" {
  name        = "ecs-task-sg"
  description = "Security group for ECS tasks"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.your_vpc.id

  # Add required ingress/egress rules
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Then update your ECS task definition or service to use:
# security_groups = [aws_security_group.ecs_sg.id] 
# or 
# security_groups = [data.aws_security_group.existing_sg.id]
```

### 2. IAM Role Issue
**Problem**: ECS can't assume the execution role.

**Solution**:
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_task_execution_role" {
  name = "ecs-task-execution-role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ecs_task_execution_policy" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy"
}

# Add any additional policies your tasks need
```

## Workflow Recommendation

1. **First apply Terraform changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan  # Review changes
   terraform apply # Apply fixes
   ```

2. **For immediate recovery** (if needed):
   - You can temporarily fix in AWS console
   - But ensure you then update Terraform code to match
   - Run `terraform plan` to check for drift

3. **For future-proofing**:
   - Add validation to your Terraform code to catch these issues earlier
   - Consider using Terraform modules for ECS that have sane defaults

## Best Practice

Always manage infrastructure created by Terraform through Terraform code - console changes will eventually be overwritten or cause drift issues. The console should only be used for temporary fixes or debugging.
